<p><span class="smcap">G. Willis</span> gratefully acknowledges the various interesting
documents and letters he has received. He is anxious
that it should be perfectly understood that he is not the
author of any statement, representation, or opinion, that
may appear in his "Current Notes," which are merely selections
from communications made to him in the course of
his business, and which appear to him to merit attention.
Every statement therefore is open to correction or discussion,
and the writers of the several paragraphs should be
considered as alone responsible for their assertions. Although
many notes have hitherto appeared anonymously,
or with initial letters, yet wherever a serious contradiction
is involved, G. Willis trusts that his Correspondents will
feel the necessity of allowing him to make use of their
names when properly required.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;The late discovery of the remains of a human
body in a complete state of preservation, in St. Stephen's
Chapel, has induced me to send you a brief notice of
several similar occurrences recorded by our early chroniclers
and historians. Bede relates that eleven years
after the death of St. Cuthbert, bishop of Lindisfarne,
the monks took up his body, expecting to see it reduced
to ashes, but found, "all the body whole, as if it had
been alive, and the joints pliable more like one asleep
than a dead person; besides all the vestments the body
had on were wonderful for their freshness and glossness."
We learn from William of Malmesbury that the body
was again found incorrupt 415 years afterwards at Durham,
and publicly shewn. Lingard gives an interesting
account of the event, taken "from a memoir written at
the time by an eye-witness," in all probability Simeon,
the Durham historian. From this narrative it appears
that when the monks removed the masonry of the tomb,
"they beheld a large and ponderous chest, which had
been entirely covered with leather, and strongly secured
with nails and plates of iron. To separate the top from
the sides required their utmost exertion, and within it
they discovered a second chest, of dimensions more proportionate
to the human body. It was of black oak,
carved with figures of animals and flowers, and wrapped
in a coarse linen cloth, which had previously been dipped
in melted wax, to exclude the air and damp." By the
direction of Turgot, the prior, "they conveyed the smaller
chest from behind the altar to a more convenient place,
in the middle of the choir, unrolled the cloth, and with
trembling hands forced open the lid. Instead of the remains
of the Saint, they found a copy of the Gospels
lying on a second lid, which had not been fastened with
nails, but rested on three transverse bars of wood. By
the help of two iron rings, fixed at the extremities, it
was easily removed, and disclosed the body apparently
entire, lying on its right side, on a pallet of silk. At
the sight they gazed on each other in silent astonishment,
and then retiring a few paces, fell prostrate on the
floor, and repeated, in a low tone, the seven penitential
psalms. After this preparation, they approached the
coffin, and three of them, by order of the prior, placing
their hands under the head, the feet, and the middle of
the body, raised it up, and laid it on a carpet spread on
the floor. It was found to have been wrapped in a cerecloth
of linen. Over this appeared the usual episcopal
vestments, the amice, alb, stole, fanon tunic and dalmatic;&mdash;the
chasuble alone was wanting, which had been
removed at the former translation in 689. On the forehead
lay a thin plate of gold, or metal gilt, thickly
encrusted with small stones; and a mitre covered the
head, round which had been wound a napkin of purple
colour. A cerecloth of the finest linen adhered so closely
to the face, that no part of it could be loosened, but between
the neck and the shoulders the skin was exposed
to the sight and touch. The arms could be moved with
ease; the hands were joined over the lower part of the
chest, and the fingers, which were still flexible, pointed
upwards. With the body were found a chalice, patine, a
portable altar, a burse to hold the linen for the altar,
and an ivory comb, with scissors of silver." When the
shrine of St. Cuthbert was plundered and demolished by
order of that sacrilegious scoundrel King Harry the
Eighth, the body was still found entire, as Harpsfield
testifies.</p>

<p>Audry, a daughter of Annas, King of the East Angles,
and abbess of Ely Monastery, died <small>A.D.</small> 679, and was
buried in a wooden coffin. Sixteen years afterwards
her sister caused her body to be exhumed. It was found
"free from corruption, and all the linen cloths in which
the body had been wrapped appeared entire, and as fresh
as if they had been that very day wrapped about her
limbs." Such are the words of the physician who
attended her in her last illness, and who saw the occurrence.
(Bede, B. 4. c. 19).</p>

<p>Wereburge, a daughter of Wulfere, king of Mercia,
died about the close of the seventh century. Her body,
according to her own desire, was interred at Hanbury.
Nine years afterwards, in 708, it was taken up in presence
of King Cöelred, his Council, and many bishops,
and being found entire and incorrupt, was laid in a costly
shrine. In 875 her body was still entire; when, for fear
of the Danish pirates, it was removed to Chester, and
soon after its translation, fell into decay.</p>

<p>St. Elphege, Archbishop of Canterbury, was barbarously
murdered by the Danes in 1012, and buried in
St. Paul's Cathedral. Twelve years after his martyrdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his body was found entire, and solemnly translated to
Canterbury. The King and Queen, and an incredible
multitude of persons following the procession from London.
A long narrative of the event is amongst the
Harleian MSS.</p>

<p>When King Edmund was cruelly slain by the Danes
in 870, his head was carried by the infidels into a wood,
and thrown into a brake of bushes; but being afterwards
discovered, it was deposited with the royal remains
at Hoxon, which were soon afterwards conveyed to
Bury St. Edmunds, and there honourably interred.
Fifty-seven years rolled on, when his body was taken up
by order of the good Bishop of London; on which occasion,
says the author of Britannia Sancta, "his body,
to the admiration of all, was not only found entire, and
without any blemish of corruption, much more like to
one lying in a sweet sleep than one dead; but also his
wounds were found all closed up, and his head united to
the rest of his body, only a slender mark remaining like
a red thread around the neck, testifying their former
separation."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;The accompanying woodcut, taken from
Gesenii Monumenta
Ph&#339;nicia, Tab. 23, fig.
59, has induced me to
send you a description
of the remaining figures
of the precious fragment,
and the history
written underneath
them.</p>



<p>The upper part of
the stone contained,
<i>probably</i>, the infant
Jesus and his mother Mary. Immediately beneath her
feet is the figure here described; and below it is an
ox at his manger; and underneath the feet of the ox,
an ancient writing, of which the following is the meaning.</p>

<p>"The illuminated star (spica Virginis) of Virgo led
the Magi slowly to the inn filled within, and in the
court-yard, with crowds of people. Arriving at the
mean cattle-stable, the Magi were." The names of the
<i>three</i> chiefs of the Magi in the place of the erasions?
From a Mukatteb inscription I get the name of one of
them, viz. "Nathan Hafi, the Grandfather."</p>

<p>Now what can the three legs, with the <i>man's</i> head
in the middle denote, but the three <i>chiefs</i> of the Magi?
And how is it that the people of Mona adopted it as
<i>their</i> peculiar coat of arms, if <i>a portion</i> of that sect did
not establish themselves, after the nativity, in the isle
of Mona? The passage in Matt. ii. 12, does not militate
against the idea.</p>

<p>Let us now take that most valuable auxiliary, Etymology,
in order that we may further elucidate the
subject.</p>

<p>Mannin, the Isle of Man, Mana, or Mona, may be
thus divided, Man-n-in. Persian, <i>m&#257;na</i>, a sect of the
Magi. Sanscrit, <i>m&#257;na</i>, to investigate, seek or desire
knowledge, to give knowledge, to respect, <i>revere</i>, <i>worship</i>.
A. Saxon <i>mont-ige</i>, <i>Mona</i> insula; <i>monige</i>, monitiæ;
<i>monigean</i>, monere, to teach, instruct, &amp;c. Gaelic,
<i>man-ach</i>, a monk.</p>

<p>And lastly, let us not despise tradition, however absurd
it may at first sight appear.</p>

<p>Among a few legends, I have been told one, probably
imperfectly, by a lady; viz. "A man was thrown from
the top of a mountain in Mona; and was afterwards,
sometimes seen as a sheep in the plain below, sometimes
as a goat." Will any person of <i>Mannin veg veen</i> do
me the favour of giving the <i>complete</i> legend; with any
other legend respecting the peopling of their island? It
may throw more light on the <i>peculiar</i> occupation of the
Magi.</p>

<p>G. W. <i>fears, with regret, that the</i> "<span class="smcap">Punch</span>" <i>Artist,

correct in its transfer.</i></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Daniel O'Rourke.</span></h2>


<p>There is a sort of mystery attached to this legend or
story, as to the authorship of it, that requires some clearing
up.</p>

<p>The first time I read it was in T. C. Croker's "Fairy
Legends," which appeared in 1825, 3 vols. small 8vo.;
but what the editor or writer calls a compressed edition,
forms a volume of "Murray's Family Library," and was
published in 1834. At page 134 of this latter edition
the story commences, as if narrated by Daniel himself,
and the writer says, "I knew the man well,&mdash;an old
man was he at the time <i>he told me the story</i>, and it was
on the 25th of June, 1813, that <i>I heard it from his
own lips</i>."</p>

<p>All this seems very circumstantial, but it is somewhat
singular that this same story, with very slight variation,
is to be found in the 18th volume of Dr. Anderson's
"Bee," for January, 1794, p. 338, the party communicating
it, saying, "The inclosed is genuine, and I honour
the <i>lady</i> who had the merit of putting it in writing."</p>

<p>There is also some account of its previous publication,
communicated in the 34th volume of the "Dublin University
Magazine," p. 202, but not having the volume at
hand, I do not recollect the particulars, my chief object
being to refer to Prior's "Memoir of the Life of Burke,"
third edition, 1839, at p. 100 of which we are distinctly
told that Mr. Doyle, a surgeon, of Dublin, was the
<i>author</i> of Daniel O'Rourke's Dream.</p>

<p>Now it is right that the real author should not be
deprived of the merit of a story, which has even been
translated into French, and published in the "Magasin
Pittoresque" for 1843, with two humorous wood cuts.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Tradesmen's Tokens.</span></h2>


<div class='right'>
Dublin, March 5th, 1852.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;I was much pleased with the observations
which appeared in the last number of your Current
Notes, (p. 11) by your intelligent Correspondent, Mr.
Boyne of Leeds, respecting the tokens issued by tradesmen
in the seventeenth century. But as he states that
the only instance with which he is acquainted of one
bearing the Arms of the Commonwealth is that which
you have engraved to illustrate his paper, it is evident
that Mr. Boyne cannot have seen Dr. Aquilla Smith's
Catalogue of the Tradesmen's Tokens current in Ireland
between the years 1637 and 1679 which was printed in
1849 in the 2nd part of the 4th volume (8vo.) of the
Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, for on the
very same page in which John Whittle's issue is enumerated,
a token for the County of Kerry issued by T. S.
is mentioned as bearing "<i>The Commonwealth Arms</i>."
From my own collection I can give another instance,
inscribed on both sides <small>A. CORKE. FARTHING</small>.</p>

<p>The list of Irish Tokens formed by Lindsay in 1839
amounts to only 195; while that published ten years
afterwards by Dr. Smith extends to 552;&mdash;and I would
respectfully call Mr. Boyne's attention to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Historic Society of Lancashire and
Cheshire.</span>&mdash;T. M. considers the Rev. Dr. Hume's
"attack" upon him ("Current Notes," for February,
p. 10) to be "most unfair and uncalled for." He,
however, admits the accuracy of Dr. Hume's statement,
and withdraws his charge of the unacknowledged appropriation
of his communication, although he questions
the Rev. Gentleman's taste or temper in accusing him
of want of patience or civility. "My copy," writes
T. M. "does not contain the pages which were forwarded
to you by Dr. Hume, and you have sent on to
me. How, therefore, could I overlook pages which do
not exist in my copy? Now, suppose no such pipe
ever existed, but in the fumes of my brain (for I sometimes
have strange fancies), and that I, in a hoaxing
humour, transferred it to paper, and transmitted it to
you. I say, again, suppose that no such inn ever existed
at Fulham as the Golden Lion&mdash;would not I have an
everlasting laugh at the learned Doctor Hume, and the
Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, and
"Willis's Current Notes?" And would it not make as
good a story as Bishop Heber's, or James Smith's hoaxes
upon the venerable 'Gentleman's Magazine,' or Dr.
Maginn's Correspondence with the trusty 'Times;' or
Hook's political information to the 'Morning Post;' or
the recent Roman Bridge affair, and Lord Goring's
cobbler's bill, about his corns, in the York papers? Look

<p><span class="smcap">What has been the highest price ever paid
for a Volume?</span>&mdash;In the course of my reading lately on
Bibliography, I observe that at the sale of the Duke of
Roxburgh's Library in May, 1812, the first edition of
the Decamerone of Boccaccio produced the enormous
sum of £2260. In the Catalogue the work is entitled&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Boccaccio il Decamerone. Fol. M. G. Ediz. Prim.
Venet. Valdarfer, 1471."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was bought by the Duke of Marlborough, and again
sold by public auction from his Library, by Mr. Evans,
Pall Mall, in June, 1819, for the large price of £918. 15<i>s.</i>
In that Catalogue it is entitled&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Boccaccio il Decamerone, (Venezia), per Christoful
Valdarfer di Ratispona, <small>MCCCCLXXI</small>."</p></blockquote>

<p>At this time it was purchased by Mr. Longman, apparently
for Lord Spencer, in whose library it is said at

that, "notwithstanding the publicity of the extraordinary
sum which this book produced at the Roxburgh Sale, all
researches throughout Europe to procure another copy
have proved entirely fruitless. This volume still continues
to be the only known perfect copy of this edition,
and is, in all probability, the only copy which will ever
be offered for public sale. Its unparalleled rarity, however,
is not its only recommendation, as it contains many
important readings which have not been followed in any
subsequent edition."</p>

<p>If any of your learned correspondents could give us
additional information as to this rare and apparently
valuable volume, it would be doubtless interesting to
Bibliographers. Has any volume ever brought a higher
price, or any work even in a series of volumes?</p>

<p>It is most probable that the other copies of this Edition
have fallen under the ban of the Pope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Smith.</span> The mention of this gentleman by
your Correspondent J. in your "Current Notes" for

language ever received so high a remuneration "per
line" for his verses as James Smith. Longman's famous
payment to Moore of a guinea a line for "Lalla Rookh"
is as nothing to it, for Mr. Strachan, the King's
printer, was so pleased with an epigram by Smith of
eight lines, that he actually, in a codicil to his will

<h2><span class="smcap">Campanalogia.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for amending the errors and omissions
about the <i>Bawdrick</i>, though at the cost of publishing
to all the world that "my writing is indistinct."</p>

<p>I also thank your Strood Correspondent for his extract
from an old Churchwarden's book, bearing on the item
<i>Baldrick</i>.</p>

<p>I would request the favour of any of your readers
who have access to old parish accounts, to publish,
through the medium of your "Current Notes," (pace
tuâ) any entry relating to that <i>item</i>, or to the "<i>Wheles

<p>It is a desideratum in Campanalogical history, <i>when</i>
and by <i>whom</i> the ingenious and beautiful Bell-wheel
now in use was first introduced. In some retired villages,
and indeed very generally in Dorsetshire, the <i>half wheel</i>
may still be found. Bells so hung and rung, are said
to be with a "<i>Dead Rope</i>." The Bell can only be
"<i>set</i>" one way, and changes could not be rung on the
system now practised, viz. changing the position of each
bell at every half pull.</p>

<p>The mention of this original sort of wheel may induce
some of your readers to wend their way into the Bell-chambers
in their neighbourhood, and, regardless of the
filthy state in which most will be found when they get
there, they will, perhaps, crawl under the bells (minding
their heads), and hunt out and report if they meet
with any clappers hung with Bawdricks and Busk Boards,
obliging many others besides your scribbler.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Pillar Print of Oliver Cromwell.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;All I can tell your correspondent, "A Young
Print and Portrait Collector," in reply to his inquiry,
p. 7, in your "Current Notes" for January, is, that I
hope I may congratulate him on the possession of a very
valuable and historically interesting engraving.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole mentions it as in "Dugdale's Origines
Juridiciales," and describes it as "a large emblematic
sheet print of Oliver Cromwell, whole-length, in
armour, with variety of devices and mottoes."&mdash;<i>Proof.</i></p>

<p>Granger describes it thus: "Oliver Cromwell standing
with a book in his hand betwixt two pillars; various
emblems. Faithorne, sc. sh." And Granger adds: "I
do not remember to have seen more than two proofs of
this fine print. Mr. Walpole had one, and Mr. Gulston
another. Mr. Bull has the original drawing. The face
was altered to that of King William."</p>

<p>A manuscript note upon my interleaved copy of Granger,
which you may remember I purchased of you, states
that, "<i>Caulfield had not less than ten or twelve of this
print, but in consequence of the size they were mostly
damaged: Coram had a tolerable good one which he
sold to Mr. Townley for thirty guineas.</i>" Caulfield,
who was a well known print dealer, says in his "Calcographiana,"
(1814), "The late Mr. Bull shewed me
Faithorne's original drawing, from which he engraved
the print, and a most brilliant proof impression; from
him I also learnt the face was afterwards altered to that
of William III., in which state, however, I never saw
it." He describes the print as "Oliver Cromwell standing
between two pillars, inscribed the '<span class="smcap">Emblem of
England's distractions as also her attained
and further happiness:</span>' <i>large sheet</i>;" and values
the print at no less a sum than £36. This was all very
well for a dealer's valuation; however, if your correspondent
will refer to the records of the Strawberry Hill
Sale, he will find in the Sixth Day's Sale of the Prints,
(18th June, 1842), that mentioned by Granger, Lot.
"761. Oliver Cromwell, whole-length, in armour,
standing between two columns, and otherwise surrounded
by a variety of allegories and emblematic devices, entitled,
<span class="smcap">The Embleme of England's distractions, as
also of her attained and further expected
Freedome and happiness</span>: sheet, <i>extra rare</i>;" which
Mr. Evans, (a dealer also), then secured for £7 15<i>s.</i>
The discrepancies between the two Inscriptions appear
to me to be worthy of remark, and if both have been
correctly copied, with what has been stated respecting
the appropriation of the head to William III., would
shew that the plate had been altered more than once.
The original plate is supposed to have been engraved by
Faithorne, while a prisoner in London for his adherence
to the cause of Charles I., and to have been so favourably
received by the Parliamentary party, as to have occasioned
his liberation; and the alteration of the head is
attributed to his son, William Faithorne, who was an
engraver also.</p>

"Rowland Hill and the Penny Postage," has not been
answered in the "Current Notes," for this month, I
will inform you that the traveller mentioned in that
paragraph was not <i>Rowland Hill</i>, but <i>Coleridge</i>. The
fact was mentioned by Mr. Commissioner Hill (brother

gave at the Bristol Philosophical Institution, on the
evening of the 29th ultimo, "on Postal Arrangements,"
which I attended. An extract of the Lecture is to be
found in the Bristol newspapers, and especially in the
Times and Gazette, from which I copy the portion which
has reference to the "Inquiry:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Many instances were related of the uselessness of the
Post-office of those days to the poor; and the Lecturer
took occasion to remark how often we were wrong and
selfish in measuring any expense by our shillings and pence,
forgetting that these nothings to us were pounds to the
poor. Amongst other instances he referred to one mentioned
in the Autobiography of Coleridge, who, whilst travelling,
observed the postman offering a letter to a poor
woman, urging upon her the necessity of taking it in, as it
was evidently from her son. The poor woman refused; she
could not afford it; but Coleridge charitably paid the shilling
for her, and the postman left, when the woman expressed
her grateful thanks, but was sorry he had wasted
the shilling, for it was only a blank sheet addressed by her
son, as a means of informing her he had reached his destination
safely. Hundreds of such expedients were then
employed, nor could it be wondered at."</p></blockquote>

produced in evidence at the trial of the unfortunate Mary,
as a proof of her pretensions to the Crown of England,

Admiralty, at the time of his death.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The history of this
fatal ring is curious: it descended from Mary to her
grandson, Charles the First, who gave it, on the scaffold, to
Archbishop Juxon, for his son, Charles the Second, who,
in his troubles, pawned it in Holland for £300, when it
was bought by Governor Yale, and sold at his sale for
£320, supposed to the Pretender. Afterwards it came
into possession of the Earl of Ilay, Duke of Argyll, and

"relict of one who has laboured for nearly half a
century in the preparation of works of standard usefulness."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">To Correspondents.</span></h2>


<p>G. W. fears that he has been taken for a conjuror, and
that a serious conspiracy has been organised against him
by his esteemed Correspondents (to whose commands he
is always happy to respond) and the Post Office. But
how is he to get on? He can only in the way of business
gratefully acknowledge the favours conferred on
him&mdash;execute orders&mdash;and do his best to reply in the
smallest type and space in his power&mdash;one column; and
with four woodcuts, which would more than occupy it
without the illustrative letter-press, being before his eyes.</p>

<p>For these obvious reasons</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Auspice Teucro.</span> (<i>18th March</i>) <i>cannot, according to his
request be inserted, as received too late.</i></p>

<p>S. S. <i>will find in the Piazza upon enquiry a communication
and facsimile most politely forwarded by Mr. Cole, in reply to
a note headed</i> "<span class="smcap">Autographic Biography</span>," <i>in</i> C. N. <i>for
Feb. p. 15.</i></p>

<p>G. S. B. Gainsborough. <i>Thanked: his communication will
probably appear next month.</i></p>

<p><i>Newspaper paragraphs of the nature referred to (about
Shakspere) seldom require contradiction; but</i> G. W.'s <i>correspondent,
as he has kindly mentioned the name of an accomplished
Prelate, will perhaps name that of the stupid Newspaper
in which the paragraph originally appeared, or the more
stupid Newspapers into which such a paragraph could have been
copied?</i></p>

<p>X.'s <i>"extraordinary" communication about "a most extraordinary
Story" was duly received. It reminds</i> G. W. <i>of an
Old Bailey piece of evidence in the case of a man who stole&mdash;not
a joke, but a pair of boots that were hanging outside of a
shop in Holborn; when followed and apprehended he attempted
to excuse himself by saying he had taken them as a joke. The
question in consequence by the Counsel was, "And pray how far
did he carry the joke?" "About forty yards"&mdash;the reply.
Now</i> G. W.'s <i>correspondent admits upon</i> X.'s <i>statement
having currently carried the joke from Lincoln's Inn Fields to
Covent Garden, and he only wishes that</i> X. <i>would take it back
again, without the interest, with some of Rogers's lost Notes.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Foss, Surgeon, &amp;c., Stockton-on-Tees, <i>9th March.
Thanked. In "Current Notes" for last month no such assertion
was made as the discovery of a "City of Pigmies," although
it was stated that two dwarfs had been brought from Central
America, and were exhibiting in New York. However, for the
information of those who are curious upon this subject, G. W.'s
correspondent C. F. D. has most kindly forwarded</i> "<span class="smcap">more
about those Aztic Bipeds</span>," <i>an extract from the New York
Herald, which will be forwarded in the proper quarter.</i></p>

<p><i>To</i> G. W.'s <span class="smcap">American Correspondents</span> <i>what can he say?
beyond sincerely acknowledging his gratitude for the favour of
their communications, and at once declaring his belief in the
Great Sea Serpent, so voluminous, so overwhelming and really
so important has been his Catch from the U. S.</i></p>

<p><i>It would literally occupy the space that he will have it in his
power to devote to Current Monthly Notes for the current
year; and he scarcely knows how to proceed in the task of
American Selection.</i></p>

<p>G. W. <i>however cannot deny himself the pleasure of acknowledging
these Catches&mdash;respecting Niebuhr and Daniel Webster&mdash;"Lord
Mahon</i> versus <i>Franklin" is important&mdash;but must stand
over. So must the Sermon of Dr. Adams of Boston upon the death
of Professor Stuart (see "Current Notes" for Feb. p. 16)&mdash;"Dickens'
American Notes," with Laura Bridgman and Longfellow's
Evangeline, appears to be a twaddlish puff. Smarter
American verses than Saxe's tribute to Jenny Lind Goldschmidt
have come into</i> G. W.'s <i>possession. With Lady Byron's "sayings
and doings" at Southampton, on board the American
Frigate</i>, G. W. <i>is quite as well informed as any American Newspaper
paragraph writer from the "Oriental Hotel" there, can be.
The Memory of James Fennimore Cooper is as dear to the
Literature of both countries as that of Thomas Moore must be.
But alas, their names can only be recorded in the "Literary
and Scientific Obituary" of</i> G. W.'s <i>"Current Notes," almost,
it is sad to think, in juxta position. Morris's "Yankee Doodle"</i>
G. W. <i>must take in hand next month.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acta Sanctorum</span> <i>received after going to press.</i></p></blockquote>
